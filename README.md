# About

This my mvp clone of the `ls` program, prep for [Bradfield CSI](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/). See the full-monty `ls` [here](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/ls.c).

## To run

From the project root: 

```bash
make clean && make
```
Then:

```bash
./mls -h
```

### TODO
- [ ] Introduce some kind of summary struct
- [ ] Support sorting flags
